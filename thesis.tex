% Sheffield Astronomy PhD Thesis Template
%
% This is the main file that produces the output PDF.
%
% Almost all of the actual content is split into individual files and subfolders to keep things organised:
% Chapters:
% - These files contain the main section of the thesis, including the introduction, conclusion and any appendixes.
% Images:
% - This folder is a place to store any images referenced to in the rest of the thesis (see the examples).
% Support:
% - These are the various other parts of the thesis, mostly front matter like the title page, summary, declaration etc.
% - This also includes files for the table of contents, bibliography etc which will be filled out automatically.
% Structure:
% - The files in here contain various LaTeX commands and functions, e.g. imported packages and formatting config.
% - Note below these are loaded using the \input{} command before the document begins, unlike the other pages
%   which use \include{}.

% ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

% Document class
% You'll want to change this based on how you are going to use the PDF:
% - Use "oneside" whenever producing a digital PDF, for reading or uploading to White Rose / ArXiv
%   This is the default, you should use when submitting the thesis online
%   This will prevent the margin and page number alternating between pages, which is annoying when scrolling a PDF
\documentclass[a4paper,12pt,oneside,openright]{report}

% - Use "twoside" only when printing on actual paper
%   This will mean that the inner margin is mirrored correctly, so there's more space when its bound
%\documentclass[a4paper,12pt,twoside,openright]{report}

% NOTE: to get the headers formatted correctly for two sided layout go to `structure/format.txt` and uncomment the lines
% in the headers/footers section

% ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

% Preamble structure, split off into separate files so this main file is nice and tidy

% First import any LaTeX packages to enable extra commands and features
\input{structure/packages}
% This file defines the page formats (e.g. margins, headers)
\input{structure/format}
% This page defines custom colours so you can make the thesis pretty
\input{structure/colours}
% This file defines custom astronomical units for use with the siunitx package
\input{structure/units}
% This file defines standard abbreviations for astronomy journals
\input{structure/journals}
% This file defines acronyms to be used using the glossaries package
\input{structure/acronyms}
% This file defines other custom commands and definitions
\input{structure/commands}

% Now we have the actual content of the thesis
% Each section/chapter is split into a separate file to keep things tidy,
% with the main text in "chapters" and the rest in "support".
% Different parts of the thesis have different formatting styles, these are defined
% below before the content files are included.

% Cover pages
% From the start we use Roman numerals (i, ii, etc) until we get to the first chapter.
% However the very first few pages have no visible page numbers, so we use the "empty" style.
\pagenumbering{roman}
\pagestyle{empty}
% ---------
\include{support/titlepage}
\include{support/quotepage}
% ---------

% Front matter
% Now we switch to the "plain" style, which just has a single page number at the bottom of the page.
% Note these are still Roman numerals.
\pagestyle{plain}
% ---------
\include{support/declaration}
\include{support/acknowledgements}
\include{support/summary}
\include{support/contents}  % contains Contents, Figures, Tables, and Acronyms pages
% ---------

% Main body
% Now we start the first chapter we can switch to Arabic numerals, which start again from 1.
% We also switch to the "fancy" style, which is defined in `structure/format.tex`.
\pagenumbering{arabic}
\pagestyle{fancy}
% ---------
\include{chapters/introduction}
\include{chapters/chapter1}
\include{chapters/chapter2}
% ... <add your chapters here>
\include{chapters/conclusion}
% ---------

% Bibliography
% Now we go back to plain style, but continuing with Arabic numerals. 
\pagestyle{plain}
% ---------
\include{support/bibliography}
% ---------

% Appendices
% Back to fancy style for any appendices
\pagestyle{fancy}
% We also want to change the formatting so instead of Chapter 5,6... we have Appendix A,B...
% The \appendix command takes care of all of this, including the headers, table of contents and figure labels.
% This means you can easily move chapters between the main body and appendixes without having to change
% anything within the actual chapter file.
\appendix
% ---------
\include{chapters/appendix}
% ---------

% And that's it!
