# Thesis Template - Astronomy students

This repository contains a thesis template for the use of PhD astronomy students at the University of Sheffield. 

## LaTeX template
The LaTeX template provided here is a cleaned version of the files that have been passed down generations of Astronomy PhD students. Students from other subjects (and other Universities) are welcome to use it if they so wish, although we recommend you check with your supervisor.

## Formatting Guidelines

The format guidelines (beyond the sections included in the template) are far and few between. There are two you need to bear in mind:
* Although single-spacing is acceptable it is much more comment for people to either use **double-space** or **one and a half** spacing for the main body of the Thesis in order to give ample room for the examiners to comment.
* Your **summary** page should not exceed **300 words**. 
* Theses should preferably be printed double-sided, in which case you want to change the page layout to have the headers alternate between pages. How to do this is commented in the main thesis.tex file.
