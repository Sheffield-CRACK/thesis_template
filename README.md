# Thesis Template - Astronomy students
_Updated: 20 March 2019_

This repository contains a thesis template for the use of PhD students at the University of Sheffield. 
Official guidelines can be found on the website and summarised below. 

## Latex template
The latex template provided here is a cleaned version for the template that has been passed down generations of Astronomy PhD students. Students from other subjects (and other Universities) are welcome to use it if they so wish, although we recommend you check with your supervisor. 

## Formatting Guidelines

The format guidelines (beyond the sections included in the template) are far and few between. There are two you need to bear in mind:
* Although single-spacing is acceptable it is much more comment for people to either use **double-space** or **one and a half** spacing for the main body of the Thesis in order to give ample room for the examiners to comment (the template uses one and a half by default but it is commented appropriately to tell you what to change).
* Your **summary** page should not exceed **300 words**. 
* Theses should preferably be printed double-sided.

## Submission Guidelines

* Submit to: **Research Services, New Spring House, 231 Glossop Road, Sheffield, S10 2GW.**
* You need to submit **3 copies** of your thesis: **2 bound copies** (ring biders are *not* acceptable, but you can use comb binders) and **one on CD**.
* You also need to submit your thesis to **Turnitin** to check for plagiarism. See below for a link to the Univesity Guidelines. 

* **PHD STUDENTS SHOULD NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES SEND A COPY OF THEIR THESIS TO THEIR EXAMINERS BEFORE SUBMISSION**
