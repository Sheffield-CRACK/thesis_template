\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
Let this be a surprise... 
%I need to thank a great number of people for their support, this may take a while.
%
%First and foremost, I need to thank the two people without whom this thesis could not have come to an end: Paul  and Clive. 
%Under your guidance I learnt a lot more than science and have grown so much as a person. 
%I am  more patient, understanding and calm in difficult situations than I ever could have beem when I started three and a half years ago. 
%This is because you lead by example and were great mentors I could look up to and rely on when I needed advice. 
%There are no words for how grateful I am to have met you, and I want to thank you for your support and guidance over the past few years.
%
%I am also grateful to the pastoral support of Richard, who was a reassuring and calming presence in the bleakest of times. Many thanks to Simon as well, I think I still owe you a Pino Grigio; come collect.
%Katie also needs a special mention. Her support ranged from proof-reading emails to double-checking my maths to being an amazing friend who was always kind and welcoming when I needed to talk. I wish I was more like you. 
%
%I want to emphasise the support of all my collaborators, particularly Dietrich Baade, Craig Wheeler, James Bruten, Peter Hoflich, Lifan Wang, Alexandar Cikota, Yi Yang, Jason Spyromilio, Ferdinando Patat and Richard Ignace. 
%
%Many thanks to Pablo (The Computer Whisperer) for his saint-like patience. Thank you for fixing my messes, and for taking the time to explain even the most basic things to me.
%
%Thank you Martin for teaching me how to read the Python manual when we were fresh PhD students. Also I wouldn't have a colour-scheme if it wasn't for you.    
%
%I want to thank Liam for all the interesting conversations we had about statistics. I never did get to use MCMC in the end, but I learnt a lot.
%
%I am also thankful to Gemma, for the great conversations about machine learning, for her help with Gaia data, and for the great time we had in Bariloche.  
%
%I want to thank Stuart for something he said to me when I was a mere undergraduate; something that followed me throughout my PhD. I was telling him during my summer project that I felt like I had no idea what I was doing. He told me that everybody feels that way. Needless to say, as an undergraduate, I was not expecting this from a teacher who I thought was supposed to know everything. Whenever imposter syndrome starts setting in, I remember this.
%
%I also need to thank Vik for a number of reasons: He is the reason I came to Sheffield as an undergraduate, he is the reason I came back, and he is also the reason Steven started working in Sheffield. 
%
%Finally I want to thank my family. 
%Thanks to Steven, my loving and amazing partner. You are my rock and you were always there for me in the worst of times. 
%
%Et pour finir, evidemment, merci a Moman et a Jeremy\footnote{(Bravo pour ton Master... maintenant j'attends ta these!)}. Sortez le Champagne!\\
