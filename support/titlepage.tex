% This file defines the thesis title page

% The format is defined by the university, it must include:
% - The full title of the thesis.
% - The author's name in full.
% - The degree for which the thesis is submitted.
% - The Department in which the work has been carried out.
% - The date (month and year) of submission.

% Otherwise the exact layout isn't fixed.
% If you want to include a different logo (e.g. the coat of arms) then that's up to you,
% there are some examples in the /images directory

% Note the actual title, name and date are defined in the main `thesis.tex` file,
% right after \begin{document}.
